      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a dedicated student passionate about web development and digital design. I enjoy creating posters and visual content using tools like Photoshop and Canva. While I’m still a beginner in front-end development, I’m actively learning HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. 
	  I’m more drawn to the creative side of tech especially designing where I can express ideas visually and bring concepts to life through layout, color, and style. </p>

    Building my personal portfolio was a fun and rewarding experience. I started with basic HTML and CSS, learning how to structure the page and style it to match my personality. The part I enjoyed the most was designing — selecting fonts, creating layout balance, and choosing colors that felt right. Even though coding was challenging at first, I kept improving by practicing little by little.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design has always been my favorite part of the process. I love working with tools like Figma, where I can freely explore UI ideas and create layouts with ease. It’s fun to see ideas come to life visually, and it motivates me to keep creating. I've also used Canva and Photoshop a lot, but recently, I've been enjoying Figma the most because of how smooth and flexible it feels. I’m also curious to try other design platforms and see what else is out there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I’m still a beginner in front-end development, I'm learning step by step. I started with simple HTML and CSS pages and now I'm exploring how to add interactivity through JavaScript. My goal is to combine my creativity in design with growing technical skills, so I can build websites that are not only functional but also beautifully crafted.
