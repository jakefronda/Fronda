  <h2>My Journey as an IT Student</h2>
  <p>
    Studying Information Technology has been both a challenge and a learning experience for me. I started with an interest in web development and design, enjoying projects that involved creativity like making posters or working with Photoshop and Canva. I’ve taken steps to learn front-end development using HTML and CSS, but I’ve also realized that programming doesn’t come as naturally to me as it does to others. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue this journey, I’m exploring other paths in the IT field. I'm especially interested in networking because I find it more manageable and engaging compared to programming. I’m still learning and trying to discover what I’m truly good at, but I’m determined to keep growing and find the right place for my skills in the tech world.
